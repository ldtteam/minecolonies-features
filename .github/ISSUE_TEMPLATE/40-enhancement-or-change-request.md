<!-- PLEASE DO NOT DELETE TOPICS AS YOUR ISSUE WILL GET CLOSED -->
### Prerequisites <!-- Replace spaces with "x" to tick boxes. -->

- [x] I am running the latest **alpha** version of MineColonies for my Minecraft version.
- [x] I checked the MineColonies/Structurize [wiki](https://wiki.minecolonies.ldtteam.com/) and made sure that my issue is not covered there.
- [x] I made sure that **this change request is not a duplicate of any existing change request.**

### Context <!-- Exact MineColonies version (e.g. 0.9.126-ALPHA or 0.9.2-RELEASE) *and* the Minecraft version you're playing, please.-->

- Minecraft Version: all
- MineColonies Version: all
- Related Mods and their Versions: n/a

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
No, not a problem.

## Enhancement or Change description
Give Blacksmiths the ability to craft tridents.

### Notes or related things
Currently tridents are mob drops only. This change would allow a Blacksmith (perhaps level 20 or higher) to craft tridents. Minecolonies includes leveling of worker skills, so I hope gating a recipe by worker level is doable. Due to a trident's strength, recipe could be 3 diamonds + 4 iron ingots, or similar.
