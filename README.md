# minecolonies-features
This is a repo only to discuss MineColonies features and suggestions. 

If you're interested in contributing to MineColonies, please contact one of our developers beforehand. This is because not all suggestions are actually planned, and it's a good idea to check this before starting work on a suggestion. We'll also help you out with hints on implementing it, code review, etc. You can contact us on our official [Discord](https://discord.minecolonies.com).
